    Hey, nice to see you
  </div>

    Allan Aww yeah, you successfully read this important alert message. This example text is going to run a bit longer so that you can see how spacing within an alert works with this kind of content.

  <hr />

    Whenever you need to, be sure to use margin utilities to keep things nice and tidy.
